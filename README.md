# Marksheet Project  

This project is a simple **HTML-based marksheet** created as part of my learning journey.  
The main goal was to practice **HTML tables, borders, and formatting** while getting hands-on experience with uploading a project to **GitHub**.  

---

## Features  
- Built entirely using **HTML** (no CSS used)  
- Uses **tables** for layout and structure  
- Basic formatting with borders and alignment  
- Simulates a marksheet-style output  

---

## Tools & Technologies  
- **HTML** â€“ for structure and design  
- **Visual Studio Code** â€“ code editor  
- **Git & GitHub** â€“ version control and project hosting  

---

## Purpose  
This was created as a **learning experiment**:  
- To understand how HTML tables work in practice  
- To try out different formatting options directly in HTML  
- To learn the complete flow of pushing a project to GitHub

## Note  
This is not a polished or advanced project â€” itâ€™s a **beginner-friendly experiment** that helped me strengthen my basics in HTML and GitHub workflow.

Future improvements may include:  
- Adding **CSS styling** for better visuals.  
- Exploring **responsive design** for different screen sizes.  
- Automating marksheet generation with **JavaScript**.
